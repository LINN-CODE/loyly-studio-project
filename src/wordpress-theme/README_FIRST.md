## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to know coding?
**A:** Not if you choose Option 1 (I convert everything). If you choose Options 2 or 3, basic JavaScript knowledge helps.

### Q: Will my animations still work?
**A:** Yes! All Motion (Framer Motion) animations are preserved.

### Q: What about my custom images?
**A:** They're imported via Figma assets and will work automatically if you upload the complete theme.

### Q: Can I edit the theme later in WordPress?
**A:** Yes, but you'll need to edit the JavaScript files. Consider using a child theme for customizations.

### Q: What if something breaks?
**A:** Just ask me! I can help troubleshoot any issues.

### Q: Do I need Node.js or npm?
**A:** No! The theme uses CDN imports, so no build process needed.
